# Purpose of the game:
This project was created for FBLA's Introduction to programming's 2024-2025 topic of creating an interactive story that allows the user to quit any time they want to. We put our love for true crime into this project by combining programming and true crime in order to bring pressing issues in our society to light.

This interactive web-based story game is inspired by the real life case of Eileen Sarmenta in the Philippines. We have done our best to try and replicate the story in a respectful but thought provoking way so you, the major, can have an engaging experience of controlling the fate of a crime case while gaining insights on how those with authority can abuse their power. We hope you enjoy!
